# D2R Sprite Toolkit

D2R Sprite Toolkit is an unofficial, free, fan-made Windows utility for PNG and Sprite conversion in Diablo II: Resurrected modding workflows.

It combines low-resolution PNG generation, Sprite preview and conversion, and batch file renaming in a single portable application.

## Basic Usage

### Create low-resolution PNG files

1. Drag PNG files or a directory into the application.
2. The default output size is 50% of the source image.
3. Set a forced size or a custom suffix when needed.
4. Run the PNG-to-lowend conversion.

### Convert Sprite to PNG

1. Load a `.sprite` file.
2. Review the preview and metadata.
3. Run the Sprite-to-PNG conversion.
4. When the output-directory option is enabled, converted files are saved to `output_png`.

### Convert PNG to Sprite

1. Load a PNG file.
2. If a same-name frame Sprite exists in the same directory, it is used as a template automatically.
3. Without a template, the PNG is converted to a static Sprite.
4. Run the PNG-to-Sprite conversion.

Always keep a separate backup of the original files. Compatibility may vary depending on game updates and the structure of the target resource.

## Automated Build

The authoritative build definition is `.github/workflows/build.yml`.

GitHub Actions builds the application on a Windows runner, embeds all required resources, and produces:

```text
D2RSpriteToolkit_v4.0.0_Windows.zip
```

The package contains:

```text
D2RSpriteTK.exe
LICENSE
NOTICE.md
RELEASE_NOTES_v4.0.0.md
```

No BAT or local build wrapper is included because the GitHub Actions workflow performs the complete build and packaging process directly.
